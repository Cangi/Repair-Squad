# Bolts and Volts

Can you keep your cool when the water levels rise and the wiring shorts out? Play in VR as a plucky plumber (not that one) or an intrepid electrician, or in MR as the literal project overseer with a bird's eye view of everything that's happening. Work together to help keep the electricity flowing and hold back the floods. Tell each other what you see - it might just save your life!
